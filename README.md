:point_right: Installation
------------

We recommend first setting up a Python virtual environment and activating it.

```bash
$ python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

And then install Ezt with pip into your virtual environment.

```bash
$ pip install ez-transform
```

:point_right: Getting started
------------

You can test out Ezt by creating a project from the command line.

```bash
$ ezt init myproject && cd myproject
```

Now you have created a project and can use your IDE of choice to start
developing your data models. :partying_face:
